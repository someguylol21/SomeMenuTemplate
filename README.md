# SomeMenuTemplate
IIdk's template ported into capuchin

Optimized version (by me, no more recreating the menu, .SetActive(true or false) goes vroom vroom)

Right Hand Menu is a bit broken (reference is a bit offset)

You can use this template however you want, but dont reupload it and say that you made it fully on your own. Always credit me and maybe even iidk when you make modified versions of my template.
